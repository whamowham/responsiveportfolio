        Kylie Ora Lobell is a freelance writer and editor and just started her first coding

        currently. She is married to comedian Daniel Lobell and has two dogs, five chickens, and
        a tortoise. </p>
        <p>Kylie is originally from Baltimore, Maryland. She has lived in Philadelphia, New York City, Florida, and Los Angeles. Her favorite places to travel to are Israel, Morocco, Scotland, and Hawaii. Her favorite foods are burritos, nachos, and basically anything Mexican. She is vegan six days a week and loves vegan Chinese food. If you need any good vegan restaurant recommendations, Kylie is your gal. When she is not working, eating or hanging out with her husband and pets, she is reading, going to the gym, watching movies, cooking, and likely doing laundry at the same time.  </p>
